Building:

The project has been tested in Visual Studio 2012 and 2013, it should just
load up and you can build directly from the GUI

If you want to build the help file you need to install Sandcastle Help
File Builder from https://shfb.codeplex.com/ and build the canape_doc.shfbproj
project.

The installer can be built if necessary from CANAPEInstaller with the WiX 
toolkit.
