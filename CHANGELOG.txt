* Added a HTTP reverse proxy
* Updates to certificate generator, allows user to specify RSA key size and hashing algorithm
* Loading previous file versions now warn the user
* Updated binary differencing tool, now tries to do a resynchronizing difference showing delete, modified and added sections. Also supports text line mode.
* New packet differencing document, allows you to compare two lists of packets then drill down into changes in individual packets
* Script editor now has per-language configuration for formatting as well as ability to select the desired font
* Packet log viewer now can have its columns configured, including custom column based on selected part of a packet and abilty to set the font (right click log and select Change Columns)
* IronPython shell extension now included with official distribution
* Support for scripted Hex/String converters in binary editor, including simple XOR template
* Added auto-backup feature to automatically save project a selected intervals
* Added history support which allows you to inspect the properties and packets associated with a closed connection
* Added credentials API and UI to request and cache user-inputted credentials, queried through calling Graph.ServiceProvider.GetService(typeof(CredentialsManagerService))
* Added flag for global meta to reset when the service is restarted
* DataKeys now support dynamic dispatch, allows you to use key.Name.Value = X like syntax in scripts
* Added scriptable packet exporter with template in C# and Python
* Added new statistics window show more properties about a packet log, also used with history viewer
* Added selection path support to logging node to only log a subset of a packet
* Single packet viewer (in log or edit window) has a paste button to replace the current packet with one from the clipboard
* Added API support to bind sub-services to the current one to allow for bound connections (think FTP)
* Current running service object can now be queried through calling Graph.ServiceProvider.GetService(typeof(ProxyNetworkService))
* Various Bug Fixes: 
o Fixed issue with serialization of script code
o Few misc crashes

Version 1.2 - 5/1/2013
* Added new style log viewer, packets can always be modified even in a service, you then can save or revert the packet
* Added option to open a separate view of a packetlog in another window which can be docked
* Added option to toggle readonly property on packetlog
* Added support for modifying referenced assemblies in scripts
* Added support for custom script configuration settings exposed via the dynamic node when configured in a graph
* Added current network service as a property of the graph
* Network client will now auto stop after making its set number of connections
* Added a simple sequential library endpoint
* Added options to disable confirmation on clearing text and packet logs
* Added python and ruby search paths to user directory so scripts can be added without writing to program files
* German translation (can be selectively enabled, also used as default language on german systems)
* Added mustaine hessian python library
* Added general create certificate tool accessible from main window
* Added support for single file OpenSSL certificate/keys
* Various Bug Fixes: 
o Fixed issue with project explorer not populating if loaded after project
o Fixed issues accessing smartcard certs
o Filtered out slave layer nodes from the injector selection box
o Updated version of window docking library which fixes display issues on Win7+
o Few misc crashes

Version 1.1 - 12/10/2012
* Release

Version 1.1 RC - 3/9/2012
* Added tooltips to the user interface to aid in working out what a feature does
* Add an option to make network logs in services mutable, rather than the current readonly default
* Added support for Proxy Auto Configuration files, either by explictly specifying or as part of the system configuration. Be careful though as the code will run with full trust :)
* Added option to proxy filters to allow them to be disabled without deleting them, makes it easier to turn them on and off
* Added option in cert creation form to specify the signing certificate
* Added global meta object to project to allow easier sharing of data between services
* Added new view options in packet log, allows you to view a single connection in one step rather than select first then view.
* Various Bug Fixes: 
o Fixed a font rendering issue in the hex editor on Windows 8
o Fixed HTTP parser to not read data on 304 responses
o Setup properties for scripted endpoints
o Fixed a few crashes
Version 1.1 Beta 3 - 20/8/2012
* Complex packet viewer now remembers what node was selected for individual packets
* SSL Layer Sections, allows you to specify a mechanism to force an upgrade of a protocol to SSL through a netgraph, next version will allow you to specify your own layers. Changed State Graph to use layer sections.
* Addition of linked nodes to the netgraph container
* Basic code-completion for C# scripts, only works for finding method names for an object (started when pressing '.'). Must be enabled from View->Configuration dialog
* More SSL options: 
o Can specify SSL version for individual directions
o Can use TLS1.1 and 1.2 if .NET 4.5 is installed
o Can enforce client certificate, also can verify client cert and server cert and reject if invalid
* All nodes in a graph can now log packets on their input and output to aid in debugging
* Edit live packet dialog no longer blocks the rest of the GUI
* Graph now has a ConnectionProperties object which maintains a list of read-only information about the current connection including source and destination addresses and SSL negotiation. Can be accessed in filters by using the '~name' selection path or by looking in the activeconnections properties state
* Added advanced options to injector, ability to specify a script to process packets before injection (say for fuzzing) and packet delaying
* Added couple of basic converters to hexeditor and text editor to convert between Base64/Hex encoded data
* More extensibility points, can create new documents and editor controls, can add new Hexeditor inspectors and converters. Cannot currently be extended through in-built scripts however.
* Various additional APIs and utility functions to simplify development.
* Added a redirect to file tab for the network services
* Various Bug Fixes: 
o Issues with large projects failing to correctly populate the project tree
o Correct handling of OpenSSL certificates and keys so they work
o Fixed some race conditions in network graphs
o DataNode names are now converted to valid XML names, possible to end up with unselectable nodes otherwise
o Added resolve handler for assemblies so can be loaded from standard extension directories
o Fixed bug in SSL certificate cloning which meant Firefox would sometimes ignore certs
o Made SSL client send destination hostname where known to handle servers which select certificates based on the extension

Version 1.0 - 12/3/2012
* Release
