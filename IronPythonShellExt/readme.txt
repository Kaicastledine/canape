This Canape extension will create an IronPython console window when starting, you can then interact
with the application to do things which are not necessarily exposed.

To install put the DLL into either the Canape\Extensions directory in program files (you might have to
create it), or under %APPDATA%\Context Information Security\CANAPE\Extensions.
